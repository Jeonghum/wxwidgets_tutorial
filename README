This project is to provide a good sample for cmake, cpack, docker and WxWidgets.
The program "tutorial" or "tutorial.exe" would run on Windows, Ubuntu and their
installers install these on Windows and Ubuntu.

You can try to use the program "tutorial" without building or installing
anything on Ubuntu/Linux once you have docker installed under conditions of
disclaimer. (Only tested with Ubuntu 20.04):

 # xhost +local:
 # XSOCK=/tmp/.X11-unix
 # docker run -v $XSOCK:$XSOCK jumogehn/tutorial:0.1

More usage guide for this project is described on wiki:
